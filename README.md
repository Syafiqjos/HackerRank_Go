### HackerRank Submission written on Golang

See me learn and study about Go Language on HackerRank.

The Problem is classified with each Category. For Example :

```
- Problem Solving
    - Easy
        - ProblemName1.go
    - Medium
        - ProblemName4.go
- Interview
    - Hard
        - ProblemName99.go
```

Some code works good on HackerRank. But somehow if you run them with:

```
go run "SomeProblem.go"
```

the inputs somehow won't saved and bugged. If you know whats the problem please let me know, really appreciated your help!
